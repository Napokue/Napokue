I develop, architect, solve problems, inspire, motivate, and teach/share my knowledge with others.

* Currently working as C# back-end developer at Quadira.
* I am learning:
  * Systems programming.
  * Graphics programming.
  * Compiler programming.
* Currently working on:
  * [Naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga), a source-to-source shader compiler.
  * [MIPS](https://github.com/napokue/mips), an abstraction layer for the MIPS architecture.
* Part of the awesome organization:
  * [gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs), they helped me immensely to push me to my limits and to learn me a lot of things.
