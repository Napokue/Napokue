I develop, architect, solve problems, inspire, motivate, and teach/share my knowledge with others.

* I am currently studying at university for bachelor of science in Software Engineering.
* I am currently learning about: Blazor, Razor (specifically the parser and runtime), ASP.NET Core and .NET best practices.
* Previously contributed to the following open source projects:
  * [Naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga), a source-to-source shader compiler.
* Part of the following organizations:
  * [gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs), they helped me immensely to push me to my limits and to learn me a lot of things.

Work experience:
* .NET/C# software engineer at [Team Rockstars IT](https://www.teamrockstars.nl/) (february 2023 - present).
* .NET/C# backend developer at [Quadira](https://quadira.com/nl/) (february 2016 - november 2022).

While I am not contributing to open source projects, I am contributing to my own personal projects. Please check out my personal project ideas tracker and progression [here](https://github.com/Napokue/personal-project-ideas-progress), to see what I am currently doing.
