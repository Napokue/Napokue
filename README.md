I develop, architect, solve problems, inspire, motivate, and teach/share my knowledge with others.

* I am currently studying at university for bachelor of science in Software Engineering.
* I am currently learning about: Nothing (university takes up a lot of my free time).
* Previously contributed to the following open source projects:
  * [Naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga), a source-to-source shader compiler.
* Part of the following organizations:
  * [gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs), they helped me immensely to push me to my limits and to learn me a lot of things.

Work experience:
* Currently in between jobs.
* Worked as C# backend develop at Quadira (2016 - 2022).

While I am not contributing to open source projects, I am contributing to my own personal projects. Please check out my personal project ideas tracker and progression [here](https://github.com/Napokue/personal-project-ideas-progress), to see what I am currently doing.
